# First day of SQL
## 1. Use the database schema named sqlclass1 
``` bash
use sqlclass1; 
```
## 2. This creates the student table with columns for roll number (Roll_no), name (S_name), marks (Marks), grade (Grade), certificate number (Cert_No), and registration number (Reg_No). The roll number is set as the primary key. 
``` bash
create table student 
( 
Roll_no int primary key not null, 
S_name varchar(20), 
Marks int, 
Grade varchar(5), 
Cert_no varchar(20), 
Reg_no varchar(20) 
);
```
## 3. Displaying table structure using desc 
``` bash
desc student;
```
## 4. Inserting values into student 
``` bash
insert into student values(1,'Tanmoy',780,'A','C001','Reg001'); 
insert into student values(2, 'Arnav', 850, 'A+', 'C002', 'Reg002'); 
insert into student values(3, 'Riya', 620, 'B', 'C003', 'Reg003'); 
insert into student values(4, 'Ishaan', 910, 'AA', 'C004', 'Reg004'); 
insert into student values(5, 'Anika', 470, 'D', 'C005', 'Reg005'); 
insert into student values(6, 'Vikram', 770, 'A', 'C006', 'Reg006'); 
insert into student values(7, 'Mira', 550, 'C', 'C007', 'Reg007'); 
insert into student values(8, 'Shaan', 690, 'B+', 'C008', 'Reg008'); 
insert into student values(9, 'Priya', 890, 'A+', 'C009', 'Reg009'); 
insert into student values(10, 'Amit', 300, 'F', '', 'Reg010'); 
insert into student values(11, 'Nina', 720, 'B', 'C010', 'Reg011'); 
insert into student values(12, 'Kabir', 640, 'C', 'C011', 'Reg012'); 
insert into student values(13, 'Zoya', 860, 'A+', 'C012', 'Reg013'); 
```
## 5. This retrieves all the rows and columns from the student table 
``` bash
select * from student; 
 ```
## 6. This creates a teacher table with columns for teacher ID (T_Id), name (T_Name), address (Address), fees (Fees), and roll number (Roll_no). The Roll_no column is a foreign key that references the Roll_no in the student table, establishing a relationship between students and teachers. 
``` bash
create table teacher 
( 
T_id varchar(20), 
T_name varchar(20), 
     Address varchar(20), 
     Fees int, 
     Roll_no int references student (Roll_no) 
);
```
## 7. Displaying table structure using desc 
``` bash
desc teacher; 
 ```
## 8. Inserting values into teacher 
``` bash
insert into teacher values('T001','Soumen Das','Salt Lake',900,15); 
insert into teacher values('T002','Rajesh Mondal','Teghoria',900,7); 
insert into teacher values('T003','Arup Kundu','Ultadanga',900,4); 
insert into teacher values('T001','Soumen Das','Salt Lake',900,12);

insert into teacher values('T004','Ashu Sir','Salt Lake',500,2); 
insert into teacher values('T005','Pranab Saha','Kestopur',1000,6); 
insert into teacher values('T005','Pranab Saha','Kestopur',1000,9); 
insert into teacher values('T001','Soumen Das','Salt Lake',900,8); 
insert into teacher values('T002','Rajesh Mondal','Teghoria',900,10); 
insert into teacher values('T003','Arup Kundu','Ultadanga',900,11); 
insert into teacher values('T003','Arup Kundu','Ultadanga',900,3); 
```
## 9. This retrieves all the rows and columns from the teacher table. 
``` bash
select * from teacher; 
 ```
## 10. This updates the roll number in the teacher table, changing roll_no=13 to roll_no=7 
``` bash
update teacher set roll_no=7 where roll_no=15;
```
## 11. This counts the number of students assigned to each teacher and groups the result by the teacher's name. 
``` bash
select t_name,count(*) as No_of_Student from teacher group by t_name; 
 ```
## 12. This returns the total number of records in the teacher table. 
``` bash
select count(*) from teacher;
``` 
## 13. This query performs an inner join between the student and teacher tables based on the roll number. It selects student name, total marks, grade, teacher name, address, and fees. 
``` bash
select s.s_name,s.Marks,s.grade,t.t_name,t.address,t.fees from student s,teacher t where s.Roll_no=t.Roll_no; 
 ```
## 14. This calculates the total income (fees) collected by all teachers.
