## 1. Use the database schema named sqlclass1 
``` bash
use sqlclass1; 
```
## 2. This creates the student table with columns for roll number (Roll_no), name (S_name), marks (Marks), grade (Grade), certificate number (Cert_No), and registration number (Reg_No). The roll number is set as the primary key. 
``` bash
create table student 
( 
Roll_no int primary key not null, 
S_name varchar(20), 
Marks int, 
Grade varchar(5), 
Cert_no varchar(20), 
Reg_no varchar(20) 
);
```
## 3. Displaying table structure using desc 
``` bash
desc student;
```

insert into student values(3, 'Riya', 620, 'B', 'C003', 'Reg003'); 
insert into student values(4, 'Ishaan', 910, 'AA', 'C004', 'Reg004'); 
insert into student values(5, 'Anika', 470, 'D', 'C005', 'Reg005'); 
insert into student values(6, 'Vikram', 770, 'A', 'C006', 'Reg006'); 
insert into student values(7, 'Mira', 550, 'C', 'C007', 'Reg007');

create table teacher 
( 
T_id varchar(20), 
T_name varchar(20), 
     Address varchar(20), 
     Fees int, 
     Roll_no int references student (Roll_no) 
);
```

``` bash
desc teacher; 
 ```
